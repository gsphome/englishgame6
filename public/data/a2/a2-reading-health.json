Common symptoms include: 'headache' (pain in your head), 'fever' (high temperature), 'cough' (to force air from your lungs with a sudden sound), 'sore throat' (painful throat), 'stomachache' (pain in stomach), 'runny nose' (liquid from nose), and 'dizzy' (feeling like everything is spinning). To describe pain, say 'My [body part] hurts' or 'I have a pain in my [body part]'."

      "content": "When you're sick, you 'see a doctor' or 'go to the doctor'. The doctor will 'examine' you and ask about your symptoms. They might 'prescribe' medicine - give you a written order for medication. You take this 'prescription' to a 'pharmacy' or 'drugstore' to get your medicine. Common medicines: 'pain reliever' (for pain), 'cough syrup' (for coughs), 'antibiotics' (for infections). Always follow the 'dosage' - how much medicine to take."

Healthy habits include: 'exercise' or 'work out' regularly, 'eat a balanced diet' with fruits and vegetables, 'drink plenty of water', 'get enough sleep' (7-8 hours), 'wash your hands' frequently, and 'avoid stress'. Regular 'check-ups' with your doctor help catch problems early. Don't smoke, and limit alcohol. A healthy lifestyle helps you feel better and prevents illness."

Don't be afraid to ask for help when you're sick!"
