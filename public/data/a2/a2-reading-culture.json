When visiting someone's home, it's common to bring a small gift like flowers or wine."

      "content": "Dining customs vary by culture. In restaurants, you usually wait to be seated by a host. It's polite to say 'please' and 'thank you' to servers. Tipping is expected in the USA and Canada (usually 15-20% of the bill), but not always in other countries. When eating with others, wait until everyone has their food before starting. Don't talk with your mouth full. If you're invited to dinner, arriving 5-10 minutes late is acceptable."
