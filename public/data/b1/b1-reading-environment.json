      "type": "theory",
      "content": "'Climate change' refers to long-term changes in Earth's weather patterns. 'Global warming' is the increase in Earth's average temperature, primarily caused by 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, creating a 'greenhouse effect'. Human activities, especially burning 'fossil fuels' (coal, oil, gas), release massive amounts of CO2. Consequences include melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disrupted ecosystems. Scientists measure climate change through 'carbon footprint' - the total greenhouse gases produced by human activities."

      "type": "theory",
      "content": "Beyond climate change, we face multiple environmental threats. 'Pollution' contaminates air, water, and soil - from industrial waste, plastic, and chemicals. 'Deforestation' destroys forests, eliminating habitats and reducing oxygen production. 'Biodiversity loss' means species are becoming extinct at alarming rates. 'Ocean acidification' harms marine life. 'Plastic pollution' fills oceans and landfills - plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose. 'Air pollution' from vehicles and factories causes health problems. 'Water scarcity' affects billions of people. These interconnected problems require urgent action."

      "id": "solutions",
      "title": "Sustainable Solutions",
      "type": "theory",
      "content": "'Sustainability' means meeting present needs without compromising future generations. Solutions include: 'Renewable energy' (solar, wind, hydro) replaces fossil fuels. 'Recycling' and 'composting' reduce waste. 'Conservation' protects natural resources and wildlife. 'Reforestation' plants new trees. 'Green technology' develops eco-friendly innovations. Individual actions matter: reduce consumption, use public transport, eat less meat, avoid single-use plastics, conserve water and energy. 'Carbon neutral' means balancing emissions with removal. Many countries set 'emission targets' to limit pollution. 'Circular economy' reuses materials instead of discarding them."
