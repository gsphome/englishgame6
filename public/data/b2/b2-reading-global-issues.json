      "title": "Economic Inequality and Development",
      "type": "theory",
      "content": "'Economic inequality' refers to unequal distribution of wealth and income. The 'wealth gap' between rich and poor continues widening in many countries. 'Poverty' exists in both 'developing nations' and 'developed countries'. The 'poverty line' defines minimum income for basic needs. 'Income disparity' affects access to education, healthcare, and opportunities. 'Social mobility' - the ability to improve one's economic status - has decreased in many societies. 'Systemic inequality' results from historical and structural factors, not just individual circumstances. 'Universal basic income' (UBI) is proposed as one solution. 'Fair trade' ensures producers in developing countries receive fair compensation. 'Microfinance' provides small loans to entrepreneurs in poor communities. 'Sustainable development goals' (SDGs) address poverty, hunger, and inequality globally."

      "type": "theory",
      "content": "'Migration' involves people moving between countries for various reasons. 'Economic migrants' seek better opportunities, while 'refugees' flee persecution or conflict. 'Asylum seekers' request protection in another country. 'Internally displaced persons' (IDPs) are forced from homes but remain within their country. 'Brain drain' occurs when skilled workers leave developing countries. 'Integration' challenges include language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. 'Xenophobia' - fear or hatred of foreigners - fuels anti-immigrant sentiment. 'Humanitarian crises' create mass displacement. 'Border security' versus 'humanitarian obligations' creates policy tensions. 'Remittances' - money sent home by migrants - significantly impact developing economies. Solutions require balancing security concerns, economic needs, and humanitarian values."

      "type": "theory",
      "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted global health vulnerabilities. 'Pandemics' are disease outbreaks affecting multiple countries. 'Epidemiology' studies disease patterns. 'Infectious diseases' spread between people, while 'non-communicable diseases' (NCDs) like heart disease and diabetes don't. 'Healthcare infrastructure' varies dramatically worldwide. 'Health equity' means everyone has fair opportunity for health. 'Social determinants of health' - factors like income, education, environment - significantly impact outcomes. 'Vaccine hesitancy' complicates disease prevention. 'Antimicrobial resistance' threatens modern medicine. 'Mental health' receives increasing attention as a global priority. 'Universal healthcare' debates continue in many countries. 'Global health security' requires international cooperation, early warning systems, and coordinated responses."

      "type": "summary",
      "content": "Understanding global issues requires moving beyond simplistic narratives to appreciate complexity and interconnection. These challenges - inequality, migration, health, climate change, conflict - don't exist in isolation but reinforce each other. Solutions demand international cooperation, evidence-based policy, and recognition that we share one planet. As you develop your English skills, engage with international news from multiple sources, question assumptions, and seek diverse perspectives. Remember that behind statistics are real people affected by these issues. Being an informed global citizen means staying curious, thinking critically, and recognizing our shared humanity across borders."
